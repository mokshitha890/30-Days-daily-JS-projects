#Intro

I have created a math calculator using HTML, CSS and javaScript . Steps involved in writing the code are firstly HTML Skeleton body was written then seperated the calculator container into three segments with the help of figma where first two components are dispaly and calculation elements kept at one side and third one at right side that is history tracker and given styles for these segments . 

Then by using grid style designed the calculation block with numbers and operaters , in javascript event listners are added for these grid elements so that we can target the elements, by usind DOM elements we have given functionality for these calculation block as well as for display block and history block.
